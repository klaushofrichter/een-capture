# 🔒 Security Update: Remove Firebase Credentials & Component Refactoring

## 🚨 Critical Security Fix
This PR addresses a **critical security issue** where Firebase credentials were accidentally committed to the repository in `scripts/cleanup-captures.js`. The Git history has been rewritten to completely remove these credentials from all commits.

## 📋 Summary of Changes

### 🔐 Security Fixes
- **Removed Firebase credentials** from Git history using `git filter-branch`
- **Deleted sensitive cleanup script** (`scripts/cleanup-captures.js`) 
- **Rewritten Git history** to ensure credentials never existed in the repository

### 🏗️ Component Refactoring (Code Organization)
- **Extracted CaptureDetailsModal** component from `Capture.vue` (207 lines → separate component)
- **Extracted CaptureDeleteModal** component from `Capture.vue` (92 lines → separate component)
- **Reduced main Capture.vue** from 2063 lines to ~1600 lines (22% reduction)
- **Improved maintainability** with modular component architecture

### 🧪 Testing Enhancements
- **Added comprehensive Playwright test** for CaptureDetailsModal (`tests/capture-detail.spec.js`)
- **316 lines of test coverage** for modal functionality
- **Tests modal opening, element inspection, and closing behavior**
- **Validates all modal components and interactions**

### 📦 Version Updates
- **Updated to v0.1.44** with proper semantic versioning
- **Updated package.json** with latest version information

## 🔄 Git History Impact

⚠️ **Important**: This PR includes a Git history rewrite to remove sensitive credentials. This means:

1. **All commit hashes have changed** after the security fix point
2. **Force push was required** to update the remote repository
3. **Any existing PRs or branches** may need to be rebased
4. **This was necessary** to completely remove the security vulnerability

## 🧪 Testing Status

✅ **All tests passing**
- Existing Playwright tests continue to work
- New CaptureDetailsModal test passes
- No functionality broken during refactoring

## 📁 Files Changed

### Removed
- `scripts/cleanup-captures.js` (contained Firebase credentials)

### Added
- `src/components/CaptureDetailsModal.vue` (new component)
- `src/components/CaptureDeleteModal.vue` (new component)  
- `tests/capture-detail.spec.js` (comprehensive test suite)

### Modified
- `src/views/Capture.vue` (refactored to use new components)
- `package.json` (version bump to v0.1.44)

## 🔍 Code Quality Improvements

- **Better separation of concerns** with extracted components
- **Improved maintainability** with smaller, focused components
- **Enhanced test coverage** for modal functionality
- **Cleaner main Capture.vue** file structure

## 🚀 Deployment Notes

This update is **safe to deploy** and includes:
- ✅ No breaking changes to functionality
- ✅ All existing features work exactly the same
- ✅ Improved code organization
- ✅ Enhanced security (credentials removed)
- ✅ Better test coverage

## 🔐 Security Verification

To verify the credentials have been completely removed:
```bash
git log --all --full-history -- scripts/cleanup-captures.js
# Should return no results
```

## 📝 Merge Instructions

Due to the history rewrite, this PR should be merged using:
1. **Squash and merge** (recommended) - creates clean history
2. **Or regular merge** - preserves the rewritten commit history

Both options are safe as the functionality is identical to the previous state, just with better organization and security.
